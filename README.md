=================================================================================
### Usage/Building on Desktop
1. Download the .zip archive and move it over to IntelliJ.
2. Make sure there is a camera attached to the computer you are using, it doesn't matter if it is ther built in one facing you
3. Run as a java application
4. Hold up the vision target in the cameras range of view and watch the console blow up

### Bugs
Currently, I know that there is one issue in `Scannable.java` that throws an IOException probably because I have not implamented the class properly

### Sources
Java 11, OpenCV
